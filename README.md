# Compare Two Arrays For Common Items

Given two seperate arrays of integers, create a function that take two arrays and check for common itemss.

Example, [2, 4, 7] and [7, 5, 1] will return true While [0, 2] and [6,7,8] will return false.

There are two seperate solution, the first being the Brute force approach in the brute approach file

Second approach, in improved.go file should solve the same problem, but with better run time evaluation
